<h2>Overview</h2>
This is a Sh'mup engine written in C/C++ to be programmed to ATMega1284 chips and an Arduino respectively. However, due to time constraints and hardware limitations, the original project was scrapped in favor of a more basic game with lasers serving as its only projectile.

<h2>Design</h2>
This is designed with objects being driven by 
The state machine design is written in respect to Frank Vahid's method of implementation. In a general sense, every task would have its own state machine that ticked after a specified period, over an automatically calculated hyper-period. This was originally taught in C in class.

<h2>Hardware Modules</h2>
1 LCD Screen
2 LED Bars
2 ATMega1284 Micro-processors
1 Arduino UNO
1 32x32 LED Matrix

<h2>How to use the Code</h2>
This code is not for practical use, nor would it be very functional. It was uploaded solely for the purpose of archiving a project, in hopes of being revived again some day when I find the time. Until then, you may
